## Directions

Press any key to start the game. 
The computer will randomly pick a word from a list of words that follow the theme of HBO's Game of Thrones. 
The user will have 10 tries to guess the word.
If the user guesses the correct letter it will appear on the right box in the correct letter location within the word.
On the left box, Daenerys Targaryen will be smiling to indicate the user got the correct letter.
If the user guess an incorrect letter it will appear under "Letters Guessed" and Daenerys Targaryen will be frowning to indicate you got the letter wrong.
If the word is correctly guessed, the user will be alerted that they have won and a new game will automatically restart and the number of 
wins will increase by 1. 
If the word can not be guessed in 10 tries, the user will be alerted that they have lost, the number of wins will remain the same, and a new game with a new word will start. 
If the user wishes to restart the game, they may press the reset button and this will reset all the stats of the game and the number of wins will return to 0.
